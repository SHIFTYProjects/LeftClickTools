There are several actions that will not work if you do not change the name of your domain in the code. I have placed a tag of <YourDomain> in the code.  In order to use all of the features, do a ctrl+F and replace all the <YourDomain> tags with your actual domain.  

U:or Z: Is a generic mapping for a company network share.  You will also need to modify this for your org.  Ive also included the tag <SharedDrive> tag to help you find this and change it to reflect your network share in the code.
